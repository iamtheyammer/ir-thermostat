# JSON Folder
This folder contains files that allow node.js and the python thermostat to work together.

## Contents
This folder should contain:
- `settings.json`: holds user settings
- `current.json`: holds the current configuration for the thermostat

In case of a problem, the default state of these files will be in json/examples.
